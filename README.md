UrbanShield is a drone-based monitoring and AI-driven detection system designed to protect cities from unauthorized and illegal constructions.
With cities expanding rapidly, unauthorized structures are becoming a growing concern, leading to safety risks, planning issues, and environmental damage.

UrbanShield aims to solve this by surveying the city with drones, analyzing captured images through AI algorithms, and providing live alerts to citizens and municipal authorities.
This ensures faster detection, better control, and safer urban growth.
